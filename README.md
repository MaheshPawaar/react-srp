# What is the Single Responsibility Principle?

> _A React component should have one specific job to keep the code clean, understandable, and easy to maintain_.

The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) in a React component means that each component should have one specific job or responsibility. It should do one thing and do it well. This makes the component easier to understand, test, and maintain. For example, if you have a component that handles displaying a list of items, it should only focus on that task and not handle unrelated tasks like fetching data or managing state. By keeping components focused, your code stays clean and organized.
